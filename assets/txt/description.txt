<p>Probably, if you are reading this document, it is because you have heard about me, in some way, by me, directly or indirectly. That's great, but now I will do the summary about me, and I will try to do it briefly.</p><br>

<p>My trip started when I was 6 or, exactly, when I literally destroyed one of the precious goods of my father, with the curiosity to know what had inside it: a computer. As you can imagine, that
computer went to the bin. Since that day, I always have wanted to be computer engineer.</p><br>

<p>I have to remark that I’m a fanatic when we talk about something related to the technology, it
doesn't matter if is software or hardware. I like to know all that I can when I have the chance to learn and "find the three legs to the cat”, which is why I find information in forums or used to buy tech gadgets when I could afford it (not now due to other bills to pay). I always be a humble guy, despite my good results (<span class="text-success">my friend Socrates taught me in a good way: "I only know that know nothing"</span>).</p><br>

<p>Usually, you can see how people define themselves with few words and I'm not going to be less in this topic. I would say that my first word is persistent (in the good way) and my second one dreamer (<span class="text-success">Yes! Like Supertramp's song</span>). These words have a relation for me, due to the fact that all the things that I have dreamed (<span class="text-success">mostly, I won't to be pedantic</span>) and have thought to do I finally gotten them (<span class="text-success">That's a good luck!</span>).</p><br>

<p>Anyway, I hope I have not bored with my stories, but there are a lot of things to tell, to live, to
share in the book of life, all of us aren't equal, all of us aren't just a CV. It is necessary to watch behind this paper to know the values that hide people and their words.</p>
